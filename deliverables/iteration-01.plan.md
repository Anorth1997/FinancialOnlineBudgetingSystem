#### Events

Meeting 1 - In Person - Planning Meeting
Date: October 2nd, 11AM - 12PM
Location: Bahen Centre (BA3200)

This meeting lasted 1 hour, before the start of the Tuesday tutorial for this course. The purpose of this meeting was to have a concrete description of our problem and how our project idea aims to solve it. We ensured that each of us understood the project’s users and purpose. Then, we proceeded to discuss potential technologies to use for our project, where we ended up choosing between Django and Flask as a web framework. We determined that we still needed more knowledge about exactly how company budgets work. During the end of the meeting, we have decided to research more about company budgeting practices, and meet on October 7th to discuss our findings.

Meeting 2 - In Person - Planning Meeting
Date: October 7th, 2PM - 4PM
Location: Bahen Centre (BA3200)

This meeting lasted 2 hours, we came together to discuss our research findings after our first meeting. We were able to get some insight on how company budgeting worked internally and able to draft a design overview of our application layout. At then end of our meeting, we decided on our project group name.

#### Artifacts
 
 * A Trello page.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* Deeper understanding of practical budgeting practices
* Finish planning of features of M.V.P
* Determine users/permissions and their corresponding functionalities
* Create basic mockups of different pages

#### Artifacts

 * Diagram detailing overall design of product M.V.P

 * Mock-ups for the webpages. Before starting our project, we should have an ideal projection of how it should look after we’ve finished designing our product. They serve as a guide towards designing the layout and to keep track of what needs to be done. They also prevent us from having different ideas about how the implementation goes.
