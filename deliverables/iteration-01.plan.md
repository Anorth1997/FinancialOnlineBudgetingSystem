# Financial Online Budgeting System (F.O.B.S.)

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration XX

 * Start date: October 2nd 2018
 * End date: October 12th 2018

## Process

_This entire section is optional. Note that you will have to fill it out and more for the next 3 deliverables so it's good to start soon and get feedback._ 

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on’’; the team and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:


Meeting 1 - In Person - Planning Meeting
Date: October 2nd, 11AM - 12PM
Location: Bahen Centre

This meeting lasted 1 hour, before the start of the Tuesday tutorial for this course. The purpose of this meeting was to have a concrete description of our problem and how our project idea aims to solve it. We ensured that each of us understood the project’s users and purpose. Then, we proceeded to discuss potential technologies to use for our project, where we ended up choosing between Django and Flask. We determined that we still needed more knowledge about exactly how company budgets work. During the end of the meeting, we have decided to research more about company budgeting practices, and meet on October 7th to discuss our findings.

October 7th, in person, at Bahen Centre. We are having it now.
 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.     

 * A Trello page.
 *   

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


## Product

_This entire section is mandatory._

#### Goals and tasks


* Deeper understanding of practical budgeting practices
* Finish planning of features of M.V.P
* Determine users/permissions and their corresponding functionalities
* Create basic mockups of different pages

#### Artifacts

 * Diagram detailing overall design of product M.V.P

 * Mock-ups for the webpages. Before starting our project, we should have an ideal projection of how it should look after we’ve finished designing our product. They serve as a guide towards designing the layout and to keep track of what needs to be done. They also prevent us from having different ideas about how the implementation goes.
