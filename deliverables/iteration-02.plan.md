# Financial Online Budgeting System (F.O.B.S.)

## Iteration 02

* Start date: Oct 16th 2018
* End date: Oct 30th 2018

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We currently have a product manager and a scrum lord. The product manager ensures that the project does not deviate too much from the final product while also reviewing additional features that the group wishes to implement. The scrum lord assigns tasks and overviews them to gauge progress and make sure that we are on schedule.

#### Events

* Oct 23rd, 10am, in-person: Before this meeting we will set up the classes for our project, and during the meeting, we will have a small code review and implement those classes.
* Oct 27th, 2pm, in-person: Further discussion on presentable artifacts and write code and implement basic functions to have a live website prototype.

#### Artifacts

* The first artifact we will produce will be a TO-DO list. Since we are just starting, we need to make sure that we do not miss an important element, and also make every member contribute by assigning each member some elements on the list.
* We are using Trello to setup tasks and assign work to people such that everyone is aware of what needs to be done and who is taking care of it. This also enables us to prioritize tasks by ordering them based on priority and deadline
* To assign tasks, we discuss in-person or on our group chat. Tasks usually get assigned to whomever has completed their previous task or to specific individuals that have experience or knowledge to solve specific problems.

#### Git / GitHub workflow 

* We will try to push on a regular basis, and not keep unsaved work on our machines for longer than a few hours. In this case, even if we were to have conflicts, in the worst case, the loss will be minimal.
* We have created two branches called "develop" and "frontEndStyling", work that entails to that specific category will take place in that branch.
* We will therefore use pull-requests from our branches to master such that the master is always a stable release. The code will be reviewed by individuals currently working on the same branch.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

* Build a basic live website prototype with pages i.e signup page, user page.
* Set up basic clickable buttons that switch between pages.
* Save user details after creating one.

#### Artifacts

* Build a static website with basic pages to present a mock-up of our final product.
* Image mock-ups of each website page to use as reference during development.
* A video to present an interactive experience.
