## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 1st 2018
 * Where: In-person, BA 3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

 * Switching from our Messenger group chat to Slack greatly heightened our productivity, this platform also enables us to communicate with our TA to ask questions or advice.
 * Assigning a Product Manager and Scrum Lord turned out well in terms of setting up a "chain of commands", i.e any questions pertaining to the product we directed to the PM and the Scrum Lord oversees each group member's work. This helped avoid any ambiguities when product-related questions arose or when a group member needed help understanding a part of the code.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * We split up our project into too many branches, we should have instead creating a branch for each feature we plan on implementing.
 * We encountered quite a few conflicts on features that two members worked on implementing whithout notifying the other. 

#### Planned changes

 * Starting next iteration, we will clean up our branches and merge them to master. From then on, we will create a branch to implement a specific feature only and not break apart the logic.
 * Organize more code review sessions and weekly scrums so that the group is up to date with our project.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

Note: To check out these files, please view the frontEndStyling branch of our project

 * We were able to set up the basic logic behind our website (pages, routes, etc.): app.py, html/js/css files.
 * The Homepage layout and buttons are functional and implemented as intended: homePage.html, signup.html.
 * Wrote a set of user stories: user.md
 * Created some dummy graphs and charts to help visualize the final product (This task was not part of the original iteration plan): graph.js

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We weren't able to set up our database in time to register and save user credentials, we have written some dummy code, but it isn't properly linked with the front-end.
 * Buttons for the CEO, Financial Head and Employees weren't implemented, we haven't gotten to them yet.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Come together and discuss our uses of branches: we plan on cleaning up our branches and push stable releases to the master branch. Each feature to implement will be a new branch such that members working on the same feature simply work on the same branch.
 * Implementing most of the front-end this iteration lightened up our workload for the next iteration considering we started with basic knowledge of html, css and js. We can therefore completely focus on fully implementing the logic behind our project.
