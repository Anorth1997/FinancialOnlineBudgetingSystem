#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

F.O.B.S. is an online easy-access budgeting platform that manages financial planning for startups and companies that wish to digitalize the whole process.
Large businesses such as Apple or Google have set up their own financial management platforms to organize funds within the company, however newly developed startups may not have the necessary resources to build their own platforms and outdated companies still use pen and paper to manage their budget - such as Pershing Systems Corporation, a taiwanese based company that works on banking software (Note: A member of our team interned at PSC and noticed the inefficiency of pen and paper).
F.O.B.S. provides these companies an easy to integrate solution for budgeting and financial services. Users are capable of viewing

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.        
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).



The target users are small and medium sized companies that do not have enough funds to set up a fully fledged financial system to manage the company budget. The software aims to be easy to integrate, while providing various features that focus on saving time.

There are three specific user types, the CEO, the financial department head, and the individual department heads. The three different user types will have different permissions within the use the software in different ways.

The CEO of a startup, wants an easy way to keep track of the company budget for the individual departments. Rather than using paper or emails, the CEO can use F.O.B.S. to quickly communicate with the departments to manage and document the budget. They will be able to communicate with financial department, and notify them of the yearly revenue goal. 

Financial department will receive the revenue goal and are tasked with distributing the revenue goal to each individual department.

Each department will receive the revenue goal that the financial department assigned to them, and will send the financial department an estimate on the budget required to reach the revenue goal.

These three user types will be able to communicate about the company budget quickly.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE â€¦

Our product helps the company save time and money, but more importantly, encourages interactions between different departments, which can be difficult for startups. By introducing a universal budgeting platform, we could eliminate wasteful spendings that often occurs in offices such as stockpiling ten thousand pens and abundant amounts of other office supplies in the supply room. Through our software, department heads can inform the financial department of what they actually need for them to allow the purchase. Instead of buying enough pens and papers that could last for an entire year, they could maybe spend the budget on a tool like ArcGIS that helps them do their job better.

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process.

One key decision we made was to lighten the load for the CEO. In the beginning, we intended to have the CEO directly interact with the department heads, but that seemed illogical as this only increases his or her workload. Instead, we now have the financial department be the main player while the CEO only serves as a supervisory role.

We also noticed that some companies use emails and paper to communicate between members of the department to discuss about the budget.
