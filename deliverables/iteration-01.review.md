## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

* When: October 13th 2018
* Where: BA3200

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Mockup design. It really illustrated what we wished to have accomplished by the end. We exchanged ideas and opinions which led to a clear and concise design which everyone was happy with. It was also established that the mockup was only an initial diagram which could have many more features.
* We assigned the roles of product manager and scrum master to two members of the team, and so far, they have been delivering.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* We attempted to create many add-ons that included different features for our project, but most of them were rejected in the end for a lack of relevance and didnâ€™t fit in our design goals in general.
* We decided to spend a lot of time naming our product. In the end, a lot of time were used and not a lot of work was done during that period.
* We discussed some languages that could be used for designing our webapp, but we realized it was too early to decide on it.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

* We will have pre-meetings in our facebook group to make sure that we do not come to actual meetings unprepared. It seems that during our meetings, we most often spend some time getting everyone on the same page before starting to work.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* We decided on the product we wish to make.
* We completed the mockup on time.
* We finished our markdown file.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* We did not go any deeper into details as we planned, but instead designed something a bit more than a M.V.P for the product. We decided that it was still too early to discuss technicalities.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Basic classes that will become the cores of our webapp. Such classes will include the different types of accounts, as well as a general account manager class that monitors, creates, and deletes accounts.
* Figuring out the relationships between each class, and how they will integrate into our project, while eliminating items and features that are redundant.
