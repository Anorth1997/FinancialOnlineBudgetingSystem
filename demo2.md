Here is the link to our video for deliverable 3.

Please note that there are slight flashes of green throughout the video.
This is caused by a bug in iMovie, where iMovie 10.1.10 has trouble working with MP4 ACC files with MacOS Mojave 10.14.
Fortunately, these green flashes do not take away from the demo content.

In addition, due to the fact that it was extremely difficult to condense our application workflow in under 3 minutes,
we will list our next steps for the final demo here:
1. Create powerpoint presentation
2. Polish front end design for a better user-experience
