Just make sure python3 and pip are installed, and install these libraries.

> pip install flask_login  
> pip install db  
> pip install passlib  
> pip install flask_mysqldb  
> pip install wtforms

Make sure you have the MySQL installed correctly, otherwise you wouldn't be able
to install the flask_mysqldb package
